# CinemaSystemBackend
This is an express API, developed using typescript, and used npm packs to complete its tasks like multer.
Using this api, not only we mak operations to mongodb collections like insert and delete for Movie, Cast and CM models, but also we validate the database through it,
by specifying the types of each field of documents, and other validators...
Also it saves the static files like images, in one of the repository's folders, and save their paths in mongodb's document; to simulate sever side scenario.
The API is designed to be consumed by an anglar CinemaSystem application that is also deployed on github.
